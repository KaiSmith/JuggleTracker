##Goals of Juggle Tracker
###Main Goals
* Track juggling balls
* Count catches
* Calculate siteswaps
* Keep track of which hand balls are in

###Other Goals
* Real time juggling analysis
* Features which would help generalize the program
  * Background subtraction
  * Ball color calibration
* Non-ball props

##Hurdles
* Coming up with a good, general algoritm for identifying catches and throws is difficult
  * Particularly challengin for 1 throws since their nature doesn't give them the arc of other throws
* Backgrounds with similar colors, which will have to be subtracted, but are currently eroded out
